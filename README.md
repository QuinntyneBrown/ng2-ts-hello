# Angular 2 starter app written in TypeScript

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 1.5 beta includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

    $ npm install -g typescript@^1.5.0-beta

## Start up the compiler

    $ cd ts-quickstart
    $ tsc -w
    message TS6042: Compilation complete. Watching for file changes.

## Updating the bundles
In the angular repo run `gulp build.js` copy over the output from `dist/bundle`
to local bundle dir.

## .d.ts Typings
The typings in `typings/angular2/` are partially autogenerated, partially hand
written. All the symbols should be present, but probably have wrong paramaters
and missing members. Modify them as you go.

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)
